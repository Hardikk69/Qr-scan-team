# Offline Camera-Based QR File Transfer System

An air-gapped, zero-network, purely client-side web application for transferring files between nearby devices using only the **sender's screen and the receiver's camera**.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern file sharing methods heavily rely on external infrastructure:
- **Wi-Fi networks** may be untrusted, monitored, non-existent, or have captive portals.
- **Bluetooth** frequently suffers from cross-platform pairing failures (e.g. between iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows) and slow discovery.
- **Cloud & Messaging Services** (Drive, WhatsApp, AirDrop, Quick Share) require an active internet connection, accounts, or proprietary vendor ecosystems.
- **Air-gapped security environments** forbid radio emissions (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, cellular) for confidentiality reasons.

When two devices are physically right next to each other, light emitted by a screen and captured by an optical camera sensor provides a universal, zero-network communication channel.

## 2. Solution: Optical Air-Gap Transfer

The **Offline File Transfer** application slices any binary file into sequentially indexed frames, renders them as high-density QR codes on the sender device's screen, captures and decodes them with the receiver device's camera, validates chunks against duplicates, and assembles the exact file locally with SHA-256 cryptographic verification.

## 3. Key Features

- **100% Client-Side & Air-Gapped**: Zero server upload, zero backend, zero database, zero telemetry.
- **React + Vite**: Small, testable modules; `npm run build` produces a static site that runs fully offline.
- **Offline Self-Contained**: QR libraries are bundled into the build; no CDN needed.
- **Binary Integrity via Web Crypto SHA-256**: Reconstructed files are verified byte-for-byte against the original hash before the user can download.
- **Fountain Coded (LT codes)**: Packets combine chunks so any missed frame is covered by later ones, with no cycle to wait for and no back channel.
- **Smart Deduplication & Missing Chunk Tracker**: Repeated or redundant packets are filtered out; unsolved chunks are tracked and shown to the user.
- **Adaptive Frame Tuning**: Easily toggle chunk sizes (300 B - 1000 B) and frame intervals (400 ms - 1500 ms).
- **Single-Screen Loopback Simulator**: Includes `simulator.html` to simulate transmission and test frame drops, cycle recovery, and reassembly on a single device.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Designed with mobile-first viewport styling, rear camera auto-selection (`facingMode: "environment"`), and subtle audio/haptic feedback.

## 4. Protocol (V3, fountain coded)

Two kinds of QR frame are shown in a stream; one metadata frame is inserted every 10 packets.

**Packet frame** (pure QR-alphanumeric, so the encoder uses 5.5 bits/char instead of 8):

```text
OT3:<transferId>:<seed base36>:<totalChunks base36>:<Base45 payload>
```

**Metadata frame** (JSON):

```json
{
  "protocol": "OFFLINE_TRANSFER_V3",
  "transferId": "M8XK2Q9Z",
  "fileName": "document.pdf",
  "fileType": "application/pdf",
  "fileSize": 1048576,
  "fileHash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",
  "totalChunks": 1311
}
```

### Fountain coding (LT codes)

Each packet is the XOR of a pseudo-random set of chunks, named only by `seed`: both sides derive
the same set from it, so the receiver can rebuild the file from **any** set of packets slightly
larger than the file, rather than needing each specific chunk. A missed frame costs about one
extra packet instead of a wait for the next full cycle.

- **Seeds `0 .. totalChunks-1` are the plain chunks in order** (systematic first pass), so a clean
  transfer costs no more than sending the chunks directly.
- **Later seeds are repair packets**, with degrees from a robust soliton distribution.
- The receiver decodes by peeling: a packet reduced to one unknown chunk solves it, which may in
  turn solve others.
- Measured packets received per chunk: **1.0x at no loss, ~1.2-1.3x at 10-40% frame loss.**

### Protocol advantages
- **Loss tolerance without a back channel**: no acknowledgements, and the sender needs no camera.
- **Session isolation**: `transferId` keeps frames from separate transfers apart.
- **Integrity**: the reconstructed file is SHA-256 verified before download.

## 5. How to Run

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm test             # protocol + reassembly unit tests (node:test)
npm run build        # production build in dist/ (works from any static server or folder)
npm run preview      # serve the production build
```

### Testing on a phone (camera needs a secure context)

Browsers only allow the camera on `localhost` or `https://`. To use a phone as the receiver:
- Run `npm run dev -- --host`, then either enable `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure` on the phone for `http://<your-ip>:5173`, or
- Tunnel it over HTTPS: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173` and open the `https://...` URL on the phone.

## 9. Performance & Practical Limitations

1. **QR Data Capacity vs. Camera Resolution**:
   A Version 15–20 QR code comfortably carries ~500–800 bytes with error correction level M. Exceeding 1200 bytes makes QR dots microscopic, demanding 4K cameras and macro lenses.
2. **Camera Frame Rate**:
   Most consumer smartphone webcams operate at 30–60 fps, with web browser decoders reliably capturing 1.5 to 3 unique QR codes per second.
3. **Recommended File Sizes**:
   Air-gapped optical transfer is best suited for files between **1 KB and 2 MB** (keys, tickets, credentials, configuration files, photos, short documents). Larger multi-megabyte files work through repeated cycles, but require patience.
4. **Lighting & Glare**:
   Reflections off glossy laptop screens or glare from overhead fixtures can obstruct QR corner markers. Adjust screen angle and brightness for optimal results.

## 10. Future Enhancements

- **Brotli / Gzip / DEFLATE In-Browser Compression**: Integrate `CompressionStream` to shrink text and PDF payloads by up to 70% before chunking.
- **Reed-Solomon Fountain Codes (RaptorQ)**: Transmit rateless parity blocks so the receiver only needs any $K$ unique packets without needing specific missing chunk indexes.
- **Adaptive Luminance / Color Coding**: Use 4-color or 8-color QR palettes to double or triple per-frame throughput.
- **Multi-File Batch Bundling**: Send multiple files or full directories inside an in-memory ZIP package.
- **End-to-End Hybrid Encryption**: Optional ECDH/AES-GCM encryption with an on-screen passphrase.

---

## 11. Security & Privacy Assurance

- **Zero network requests** are dispatched during transmission.
- Files remain strictly in volatile memory (`ArrayBuffer`) and browser sandbox.
- Transferred data is never written to `localStorage` or external storage.
- Optical transfer leaves no radio-frequency footprint.
